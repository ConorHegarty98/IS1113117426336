                <h3><strong>Software as a Service</strong></h3>
            <div class="saas">
                <p class="saas_text">Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. 
                SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). SaaS removes the need for 
                organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and
                maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Other benefits of the SaaS model include flexible payments, scalable usage and automatic updates.
                Salesforce is one the top companies using SaaS efficiently.

                <h3><strong>Platform as a Service</strong></h3>
            <div class="paas">
                <p class="paas_text">Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools usually those needed for application development
                to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software 
                to develop or run a new application. Many PaaS products are geared toward software development. These platforms offer compute and storage infrastructure, as well as text editing, version
                management, compiling and testing services that help developers create new software more quickly and efficiently. A PaaS product can also enable development teams to collaborate and work 
                together, regardless of their physical location. The main benefit of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users. Cloud 9 is a business operating PaaS.

                <h3><strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong></h3>
            <div class="iaas">
                <p class="iass_text"> Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories
                of cloud computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present
                in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. Organizations choose IaaS because it is often easier, faster 
                and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without having to buy, manage and support the underlying infrastructure. With IaaS, a business can simply rent or lease that infrastructure from another 
                business. An example of a company offering a SaaS is Amazon.

                <h3><strong>Communication as a Service</strong></h3>
            <div class=" caas">
                <p class="cass_text"> Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP 
                (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service 
                (SaaS). The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices
                and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.
                CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. Gmail offers CaaS.
