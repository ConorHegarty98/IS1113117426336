                 <h1>Most Travelled to: America</h1>
            	
            	<br><p>I have been to America five times. I have travelled to New York, San Diego and Los Angeles. The main reason for my vists have been to see family.
                My brother and uncle live in the states. I enjoyed observing the different culture and lifestyle that exists over.With millions of people living in the United States, 
                there is no doubt a lot of diversity, and sometimes just sitting and watching people can be fascinating.</p>
                </br>
              
    
                <p>My favoutite location in America was San Diego. Firstly I really enjoyed the semi-arid Mediterranean climate, which ensures mild sunny weather throughout the year.
                The pleasant climate allowed for lots of outdoor activities and generally everyone is in a better mood. I particularly liked the lifestyle which consisted of working 
                early and going to the becah or getting out in the afternoon. I certainly preferred the realaxed Californian lifetstyle to the speed and relentlessness of New York.</p>

    	       <h1>Want to visit: China</h1>
    	       
    	       <br><p>Firstly I would like to visit China becuase of its incredibly diverse landscapes. Moreover it boasts some of the worlds most popular tourist attractions such 
    	       as the Great Wall of China and the Terracotta Warriors. At the same time, China has some of the largest cities in the world and is becoming more modern everywhere you look 
    	       for example Shanghai epitomises modern day China, with the famous modern riverfront skyline known as the Bund, and its particularly distinctive Pearl of the Orient tower.</p></br>
    	   
    	       <p>One of the most amazing things about China is the variety of experience that can be enjoyed in one place.  China makes a wide variety of products that are exported all over the world, but they have many unique products as well. Fine silks, exquisite China tea sets,
    	       elaborately carved jade, and expensive aged tea are some of the most sought after high-priced commodities.</p>

             <h1>Settle in: Cork</h1>
    	            
             <br><p>I would like to settle in Cork for several reasons. The main reason for this is that most of my family lives here and it would allow me to spend time with them.
    	            Also I thnk Cork has great job opportunities because of its location, this includes multinational companies sucha as Apple, VMware and EMC. Cork is relatively 
    	            small and offers good choices between living in the countryside or suburbs. It would also enable me to continue playing GAA for my local club.</p></br>
    	
    	            
    	         <p>Cork is a vibrant city awash with multiculturalism, central business districts, live music venues and vibrant restaurants, but the city has never lost its 
    	        unique culture and the people living here are testament to that. Furthermore the pace of life is slower than in Dublin due to the easy-going, relaxed nature
    	        of the people.</p>
