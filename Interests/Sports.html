         <br>
         I am member of Bishopstown GAA and play under 21 and 
         senior hurling for the club. I train twice a week with Bishopstown
         and have a game at weekends. Recently I started playing for 
         UCC freshers hurling team.I train once a week with them and 
         would have a game another night.I have gained numerous skils form 
         sport that can be applied in practical situations such as 
         leadership, teamwork and social interaction skills. Furthermore I
         am involved in coaching in my club. I help out with the minor 
         hurling team and I enjoy giving something back. I enjoy coaching 
         as it is a good way of working on communication skills. As well as
         playing sport I enjoy watching different sports such as soccer, 
         rugby and basketball and observing the necessary skills needed 
         some of which are universal to all sports.
